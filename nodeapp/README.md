This app uses nodejs to run javascript and make a fetch call to an API endpoint.

We can see in [package.json](package.json) that we have included a dependency on the [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) library.

To run the code, run [startnodeRun.sh](startnodeRun.sh).

This image shows the node app running in a local terminal.
