This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

We can see in [package.json](package.json) that we have included a dependency on the [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) library.

## Getting Started

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
